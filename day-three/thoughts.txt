9. On one of the test, the output was 20, 20, and 10, 20 in all other tests.
Because of data races, and before thread 1 gets the value to print, thread
2 has already saved it's value as 20. Usually (10,20) thread one finishes first
before thread two has even started incrementing it seems. This would be
as a result of scheduler algorithms.

10. On one of the test, the output was 11, 11, and 20, 20 in all other tests.
This is expected because of data races too. This scenario is really similar
to what happened in the animation on the slide, where the counter is not
incremented properly.
