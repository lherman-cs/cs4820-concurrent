CSCI4900

--------------------------------------
The program was written on Python 3.3
--------------------------------------

I soft installed it on my nike account, and everything
runs except the last one. Must be nike's ssl certificate
is not valid anymore.

Note: I have done all the CSCI6900 only problems as well.
I enjoyed the python coding style, a lot more than scala.
I just thought that the extra credit dealt with my department
of expertise, Web Income.

The extra information in the html file is for passing:
This document was successfully checked as HTML 4.01 Strict!
As with all things, there are standards.
After running the program one can visit this site and paste
the html source code.

Step 5: Animal
The animal appears to be a human in a bunny suit.
He/She is reading a book while sitting down on a park bench, with
his/her bookbag on his/her left.

Some Example Runs:
python main.py
python wordcount.py --topcount alice.txt 100
python wordcount.py --count small.txt
python mimic.py alice.txt world 20
python logpuzzle.py --todir animal animal_code.google.com
