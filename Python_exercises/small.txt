We shape our self to fit this world
and by the world are shaped again.

The visible and the invisible working together in common cause,
to produce the miraculous.

I am thinking of the way the intangible air passed at speed round a shaped wing
easily holds our weight.

So may we, in this life trust to those elements we have yet to see or imagine,
and look for the true shape of our own self, by forming it well to the great
intangibles about us.
